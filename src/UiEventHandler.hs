{-
    Intermediate event handlers.
    These will act as a bridge from IO monad to pure code.

    These will:
        1. read in current mutable state from IORef
        2. get all necessary data from the EventWhatever

        In case of event that is purely UI specific (such as ViewScale change etc.)
            3. update state directly without going any further

        In case of domain specific action,
            3. call dispatchAction and
            4. replace mutable state with state returned by dispatchAction
